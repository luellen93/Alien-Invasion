This game was created using the walkthrough in the Python Crash Course, Third Edition textbook. Some of the elements, such as sound and sprites, were chosen and added by myself. They can also be manipulated if you add your own files 
to replace them. This game was created to help gain an understanding of the Pygame library as well as how to utilize different python files for the same program.
